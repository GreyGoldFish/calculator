# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a web-based calculator designed for learning purposes as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It demonstrates several key programming concepts:

## Key Concepts

### 1. JavaScript Functionality
- Functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are defined.
- Event listeners capture user input and trigger corresponding actions.

### 2. Handling User Input
- Decimal numbers are supported, and input validation prevents multiple decimal points.

### 3. Displaying Results
- Real-time display of the current operation and the calculated result is implemented.

### 4. Clearing and Undoing Actions
- Buttons for "AC" (clear) and "CE" (undo) allow users to manage their input.

## Usage
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or access it [here](https://greygoldfish.github.io/calculator/).
